**Can you look over the "Implenetation Plan" document, and see if we're missing anything from this prisma schema?**

The "Implementation Plan" document outlines several entities and features that need to be implemented. Comparing it with the `schema.prisma` file, here are some observations:

### Missing or Incomplete Features in the Prisma Schema:
1. **Event Phase Transitions**:
   - The `phase` field in the `Event` model is a `String`. It might be better to use an `enum` for predefined phases (`open`, `voting`, `closed`, `archived`) to ensure consistency.

2. **Image Upload and Storage**:
   - The `Artwork` model has an `images` field as `Json`. If image validation and resizing are required, consider adding metadata fields (e.g., `imageType`, `imageSize`, etc.) or a separate `Image` model for better control.

3. **Authentication**:
   - The `Artist` model includes `passwordHash` and `resetToken`. However, session management and invitation token validation are mentioned in the plan but not reflected in the schema. You might need a `Session` model or additional fields for tracking active sessions.

4. **Notifications**:
   - The `Notification` model is present, but the `type` field is an `enum`. Ensure all notification types (`MATCH`, `EVENT`, `FLAG`, `OTHER`) are covered.

5. **Voting Logic**:
   - The `Match` model includes `status` as a `String`. Consider using an `enum` for predefined statuses (`pending`, `completed`, etc.).

6. **Error Handling and Validation**:
   - The schema does not include fields for tracking validation errors or logs. If error handling is critical, you might need a `Log` or `Error` model.

7. **Admin Moderation Tools**:
   - The schema does not include fields for flagging or moderating artworks. You might need a `Flag` model or a `flagged` field in the `Artwork` model.

8. **Terms of Service and Privacy Policy**:
   - The schema does not include fields for tracking user agreement to terms of service or privacy policy. Consider adding a `termsAccepted` field in the `Artist` model.

9. **Push Notifications**:
   - If push notifications are planned, you might need a `Device` model to track user devices and tokens.

10. **Data Retention Features**:
    - The schema does not include fields for tracking data retention or deletion requests. Consider adding a `deletedAt` field to models for soft deletion.

### Recommendations:
- Add enums for fields like `Event.phase` and `Match.status` to ensure consistency.
- Consider adding models or fields for session management, flagging, and push notifications.
- Review the `images` field in the `Artwork` model to ensure it meets the requirements for image upload and storage.
- Add fields for tracking user agreement to terms of service and privacy policy.

Would you like me to update the schema with these recommendations?

**yes please**

The changes were applied successfully, but there are validation errors due to missing opposite relation fields in the `Artist` and `Artwork` models for the new `Session`, `Flag`, and `Device` models. I will fix these by adding the necessary relation fields.

The missing relation fields have been added to the `Artist` and `Artwork` models to resolve the validation errors. Let me know if you need further assistance!
