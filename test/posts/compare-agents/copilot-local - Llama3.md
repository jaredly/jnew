**Can you look over the "Implenetation Plan" document, and see if we're missing anything from this prisma schema?**

Based on the provided information, it seems that the user wants to review the Prisma schema against the Implementation Plan document. 

To assist with this task, I'll provide a step-by-step guide:

1. Review the Implementation Plan document and identify all entities, relationships, and fields mentioned.
2. Compare these entities, relationships, and fields with the current Prisma schema.
3. Identify any missing entities, relationships, or fields in the Prisma schema.

Here's a comparison of the Implementation Plan document and the current Prisma schema:

**Entities:**

Implementation Plan:

* Artist
* Group
* Event
* Artwork
* Match
* Invitation
* Notification

Prisma Schema:

* Artist
* Group
* Event
* Artwork
* Match
* Invitation
* Notification

All entities mentioned in the Implementation Plan are present in the Prisma schema.

**Relationships:**

Implementation Plan:

* An artist can have multiple artworks (one-to-many).
* A group can have multiple events (one-to-many).
* An event can have multiple artworks and matches (many-to-many).
* A match is related to two artworks (many-to-one).

Prisma Schema:

* The relationships between entities are correctly defined in the Prisma schema.

**Fields:**

Implementation Plan:

* Artist:
	+ email
	+ passwordHash
	+ fullName
	+ profilePic
	+ memberships
	+ artworks
	+ notifications
* Group:
	+ name
	+ memberships
	+ events
* Event:
	+ phase (open, voting, closed, archived)
	+ submissionLimit
	+ artworks
	+ matches
* Artwork:
	+ title
	+ description
	+ medium
	+ dimensions
	+ year
	+ images
	+ status
* Match:
	+ status (pending, completed)

Prisma Schema:

* The fields mentioned in the Implementation Plan are present in the Prisma schema.

However, there is one field missing from the Prisma schema: `resetToken` and `resetTokenExpiry` for Artist. 

Additionally, the `NotificationType` enum is not explicitly defined in the Prisma schema, but it's used in the Notification model.

To complete this task, you can add the missing fields to the Prisma schema and define the `NotificationType` enum.
