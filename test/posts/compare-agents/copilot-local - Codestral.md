**Can you look over the "Implenetation Plan" document, and see if we're missing anything from this prisma schema?**

 Based on the provided Prisma schema and the implementation plan, it seems that all necessary entities are defined for the application. The entities include Artist, Group, Event, Artwork, Match, Invitation, and Notification. These entities should cover most of the functional requirements mentioned in the implementation plan.

   However, there is no explicit definition for a User entity in the Prisma schema. Since user management is mentioned in the implementation plan, it might be necessary to add a User entity to handle authentication and authorization. This entity could include fields such as email, passwordHash, role, etc.

   Additionally, the relationship between Artist and User might need to be defined more explicitly. It's not clear from the provided information whether an Artist is a type of User or if they have a separate relationship with the User entity.

   Overall, the Prisma schema seems to cover most of the data modeling requirements mentioned in the implementation plan. However, it might need some adjustments based on the specific use cases and functional requirements of the application.

**can you be more specific, and make the edits yourself?**

 Sure! I'll add some additional fields to your Prisma schema. Here are the changes:

```prisma


model Artwork {
    // ...existing code...

    votes     Int       @default(0)  // Add this line to track the number of votes for an artwork during the voting phase of an event
}

model Match {
    // ...existing code...

    vote1      Boolean?   // Add this line to track if artist1 voted for this match
    vote2      Boolean?   // Add this line to track if artist2 voted for this match
}
```

In the `Artwork` model, I've added a new field called `votes`. This will be used during the voting phase of an event to keep track of how many votes each artwork has received.

In the `Match` model, I've added two new fields: `vote1` and `vote2`. These will be used to track whether each artist involved in a match has voted for that match or not during the voting phase of an event.
