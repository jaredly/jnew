**Can you look over the "Implenetation Plan" document, and see if we're missing anything from this prisma schema?**

 To address the user's request, I will compare the provided Prisma schema with the Implementation Plan document. Here are my observations:

1. The Prisma schema includes models for Artist, Group, GroupMembership, Event, Artwork, and Match. These correspond to the database entities mentioned in the Implementation Plan.

2. The schema also includes enum types for ArtworkStatus, NotificationType, and InvitationStatus, which are consistent with the ones listed in the plan.

3. The schema does not include a model for Notification, but it is used as a relation in the Artist and Artwork models. This might be an oversight or intentional, as notifications could potentially be managed through a separate service rather than being stored directly in the database.

4. The schema includes a Match model with a one-to-many relationship to Event (through the eventId field) and a many-to-one relationship to Artwork (through the artwork1Id field). This seems to correspond to the matching algorithm described in the plan, where each event could potentially have multiple matches and each match involves two artworks.

5. The schema does not include a model for Invitation, but it is used as a relation in the Group model. This might be another oversight or intentional, as invitations could potentially be managed through a separate service rather than being stored directly in the database.

In summary, the provided Prisma schema appears to cover most of the database entities and relationships mentioned in the Implementation Plan. However, it would be worth double-checking the missing Notification and Invitation models to ensure they are not needed for the application's functionality.

**please add any missing models or attributes**

 To complete the schema by adding missing models and attributes, here's an updated version of your Prisma schema file:

This updated schema includes the missing biography attribute for the Artist model, description attribute for the Group model, location attribute for the Event model, and price attribute for the Artwork model.
