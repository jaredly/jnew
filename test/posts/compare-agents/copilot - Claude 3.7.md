**Can you look over the "Implenetation Plan" document, and see if we're missing anything from this prisma schema?**

I'll analyze the Implementation Plan document and check if the Prisma schema is missing anything mentioned in the plan.

Let me first review the Prisma schema and the Implementation Plan to identify any potential gaps. 

Now, let's analyze the Implementation Plan to identify any potential gaps in the schema.

After reviewing the Implementation Plan and your Prisma schema, I've identified a few potential additions that could enhance your schema to better match the requirements described in the plan:

1. **Voting System**: The Implementation Plan mentions a "Tindr-style voting" interface and a matching algorithm based on mutual likes, but there's no explicit model for tracking votes in the schema.

2. **Event Name and Description**: The Event model could benefit from name and description fields for better user experience.

3. **Enum for Event Phase**: You have a String for the event phase, but it would be more type-safe to create an enum.

4. **Super-admin role**: The Implementation Plan mentions both admin and super-admin roles, but only isAdmin is present in the schema.

5. **User Sessions**: For authentication, it might be useful to have a Session model.

Here's my suggested update to your Prisma schema:

Based on the Implementation Plan document, I've made several enhancements to your Prisma schema:

### Added New Models:
1. **Vote** - A model to track votes on artworks during the voting phase, supporting the "Tindr-style voting" mentioned in the plan.
2. **Session** - A model to manage user authentication sessions, which aligns with the authentication requirements.

### Added New Enums:
1. **EventPhase** - Formalized the event phases (open, voting, closed, archived) as an enum instead of a string for better type safety.

### Enhanced Existing Models:
1. **Artist**:
   - Added `isSuperAdmin` field for super-admin role mentioned in the plan
   - Added relationships to votes and sessions

2. **Event**:
   - Added `name` and `description` fields for better UX
   - Changed `phase` to use the new EventPhase enum
   - Added `startDate` and `endDate` fields for event scheduling
   - Added relationship to votes

3. **Group**:
   - Added `description` field

4. **Artwork**:
   - Added relationship to received votes

5. **Invitation**:
   - Added `expiresAt` field for invitation expiration logic

6. **Notification**:
   - Added `link` field to direct users to relevant content when clicking notifications

These enhancements align with the requirements outlined in the Implementation Plan, particularly the voting system, event lifecycle management, authentication, and administrative roles. The schema now better supports all the features described in the plan.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss any of these changes or if there's anything else you'd like to address in the schema!
