**Can you look over the "Implenetation Plan" document, and see if we're missing anything from this prisma schema?**

-----------------------------------

**@agent Enable: "Enable Claude Sonnet 3.5 for all clients"**

I'll analyze the Implementation Plan and compare it with the current Prisma schema to identify any missing elements.

Looking at both documents, here are a few things that should be added to the schema:

1. Event should have a name/title field and description field as these would be important for users to identify different events
2. Event phases should be an enum rather than a string field for type safety
3. The Group model could benefit from a description field
4. The Artist model should have fields for account verification since email verification is mentioned in the implementation plan
5. The Match model could benefit from a createdBy field to track which admin created the match

Let me update the schema to include these:

After reviewing both documents, I can confirm that the schema now includes all the necessary fields mentioned in the Implementation Plan. The schema includes:

1. All core entities (Artist, Group, Event, Artwork, Match, Invitation, Notification)
2. Email verification and password reset functionality for Artists
3. Group membership and admin roles
4. Event phases and submission limits
5. Artwork status tracking
6. Match creation and tracking
7. Notification system
8. Invitation system

The schema appears to be well-structured and should support all the functionality described in the Implementation Plan. The enums help ensure type safety for status fields, and the relationships between models are properly defined with appropriate foreign keys.

Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the schema in more detail or if you have specific concerns about any functionality described in the Implementation Plan.
