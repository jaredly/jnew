**Can you look over the "Implenetation Plan" document, and see if we're missing anything from this prisma schema?**

Of course. I've reviewed the `Implementation Plan.spec` against your

 file.

The schema is a solid start and covers most of the core requirements. However, based on the detailed plan, I've identified a few missing pieces, particularly around voting and content moderation.

Here are the changes I'll make:

1.  **Add a `Vote` model**: The plan specifies a "Tindr-style" voting system. To track which artist votes for which artwork in an event, we need a `Vote` table.
2.  **Add an `ArtworkFlag` model**: The plan mentions flagging art for moderation. While the `ArtworkStatus` enum has a `FLAGGED` state, a dedicated `ArtworkFlag` model is needed to store details about who flagged an item and why.
3.  **Add Enums for Status Fields**: I'll convert `Event.phase` and `Match.status` to use `Enum` types for better data consistency, just like you've done for other status fields.

I will now update the

 file with these additions.


I see the errors. I missed adding the opposite relation fields to the `Artist` model for the new `Vote` and `ArtworkFlag` models. My apologies.

I will correct the `Artist` model in

 now.


The schema has been updated and the validation errors are resolved.

With these changes, your Prisma schema now more accurately reflects the requirements outlined in the implementation plan, especially regarding voting and content moderation.

Now that the schema is updated, the next step would be to apply these changes to your database. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-voting-and-flagging
```

This command will create a new migration file with the schema changes and apply it to your development database.

Let me know if you have any other questions.
