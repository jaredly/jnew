Can you look over the "Implenetation Plan" document, and see if we're missing anything from this prisma schema? ImplementationPlan.spec schema.prisma 

# assistant message

Based on the provided "Implementation Plan" document and Prisma schema file, it appears that the plan covers most of the requirements for the ArtSwap application. However, there are a few potential issues or areas for improvement:

1. **Missing relationship between Match and Event**: The Prisma schema defines a relationship between Match and Artwork (via `MatchArtwork1` and `MatchArtwork2`), but it does not define a direct relationship between Match and Event.
2. **Missing Notification type "ART"**: In the Implementation Plan, there is a mention of using an in-app notification system to inform users about matches. However, the Prisma schema only defines three types of notifications: MATCH, EVENT, and FLAG. It would be beneficial to add a new type for ART-related notifications.
3. **Lack of detailed testing strategy**: While the plan mentions writing unit tests and integration tests, it does not provide a clear outline of what specific tests should be written or how they should be executed.
4. **Inadequate documentation**: The Implementation Plan is quite comprehensive, but it could benefit from more detailed comments and explanations to help readers understand the thought process behind certain design decisions.

To address these concerns, you may want to consider revising the Prisma schema file as follows:

1. Add a relationship between Match and Event:
```prisma
model Match {
    id         String   @id @default(uuid())
    event      Event    @relation(fields: [eventId], references: [id])
    eventId    String
    artwork1   Artwork? @relation("MatchArtwork1", fields: [artwork1Id], references: [id])
    artwork1Id String   @unique
    artwork2   Artwork? @relation("MatchArtwork2", fields: [artwork2Id], references: [id])
    artwork2Id String   @unique
    status     String // e.g., pending, completed
    createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
}

model Event {
    id              String    @id @default(uuid())
    group           Group     @relation(fields: [groupId], references: [id])
    groupId         String
    phase           String // open, voting, closed, archived
    submissionLimit Int
    artworks        Artwork[]
    matches         Match[]  // Add this line to define the relationship between Event and Match
    createdAt       DateTime  @default(now())
}
```

2. Add a new Notification type "ART":
```prisma
model Notification {
    id        String   @id @default(uuid())
    artist    Artist   @relation(fields: [artistId], references: [id])
    artistId  String
    type      NotificationType // Update this line to include the new ART type
    message   String
    read      Boolean  @default(false)
    createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}

enum NotificationType {
  MATCH
  EVENT
  FLAG
  ART // Add this line to define the new ART notification type
}
```

These revisions will ensure that the Prisma schema accurately reflects the requirements outlined in the Implementation Plan. However, it's essential to carefully review and test any changes before deploying them to production.
