**Can you look over the "Implenetation Plan" document, and update this prisma schema with anything I've missed?**

Here's an updated version of the Prisma schema that incorporates your feedback:

This updated schema includes the following changes:

1. `GroupMembership` is a new model that represents the membership of an `Artist` in a `Group`. It has a many-to-many relationship with both `Artist` and `Group`, and it also stores whether the artist is an admin or not.
2. `EventPhase` is a new enum that represents the different phases of an event, such as open for submissions, voting, and closed/archived.
3. `Vote` is a new model that represents a vote by an `Artist` on an `Artwork` for an `Event`. It has a many-to-one relationship with all three models, and it also stores the timestamp of the vote.
4. The `Event` model now has a `phase` field to track its current phase.
5. The `Match` model is updated to include the `event` field for the event that the match was created in.
6. The `Invitation` model is updated to include the `group` field for the group that the invitation is for.
7. The `Notification` model is updated to include the `type` and `message` fields, as well as a `read` flag to track whether the notification has been read by the user.
8. The `Artist` model is updated to include the `resetToken` and `resetTokenExpiry` fields for password reset functionality.
9. The `Artwork` model is updated to include the `status` field to track its current status, such as in a portfolio or attached to an event.
10. The `Event` model is updated to include the `description` field to provide more details about the event.
11. The `Group` model is updated to include the `createdAt` field to track when the group was created.
12. The `Artist` model is updated to include the `fullName` and `profilePic` fields for additional user information.


The updated schema incorporates your feedback by adding new models, enums, and fields to the existing models. It also updates some of the existing models to include additional fields or relationships as needed. This ensures that the Prisma schema is aligned with the requirements of the project and can be used to generate a database schema that meets the needs of the application.

Note: You may need to adjust the filepath for the updated schema based on your project structure.
