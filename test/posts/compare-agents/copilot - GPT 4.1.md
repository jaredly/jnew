**Can you look over the "Implenetation Plan" document, and see if we're missing anything from this prisma schema?**

Based on the "Implementation Plan" and your current Prisma schema, here’s a comparison and gap analysis:

### Entities Required by the Plan:
- **Artist**: Present
- **Group**: Present
- **Event**: Present
- **Artwork**: Present
- **Match**: Present
- **Invitation**: Present
- **Notification**: Present

### Key Features/Fields from the Plan:
- **Authentication**: `passwordHash`, `resetToken`, `resetTokenExpiry` in `Artist` (good)
- **Memberships**: `GroupMembership` model (good)
- **Event Phases**: `phase` field in `Event` (string, could be enum for safety)
- **Art Submission**: `Artwork` model (good)
- **Voting**: No explicit `Vote` or voting record model
- **Matching**: `Match` model (good)
- **Notifications**: `Notification` model (good)
- **Invitations**: `Invitation` model (good)
- **Image Upload**: `Artwork.images` as `Json` (good for flexibility)
- **Admin Tools**: `isAdmin` in `GroupMembership` (good)
- **Flagging**: `ArtworkStatus.FLAGGED` (good)
- **Event Submission Limit**: `submissionLimit` in `Event` (good)

### What’s Missing or Could Be Improved:
1. **Voting Records**:
   - The plan calls for voting logic and a Tindr-style interface.
   - There is no model for recording individual votes (who voted for which artwork, and what was the vote).
   - Suggest adding a `Vote` model:
     ```prisma
     model Vote {
       id        String   @id @default(uuid())
       event     Event    @relation(fields: [eventId], references: [id])
       eventId   String
       voter     Artist   @relation(fields: [artistId], references: [id])
       artistId  String
       artwork   Artwork  @relation(fields: [artworkId], references: [id])
       artworkId String
       value     Int      // 1 for like, 0 for pass, or use enum
       createdAt DateTime @default(now())
     }
     ```

2. **Event Phase Enum**:
   - `Event.phase` is a string, but the plan specifies phases: open, voting, closed, archived.
   - Suggest changing to an enum for safety:
     ```prisma
     enum EventPhase {
       OPEN
       VOTING
       CLOSED
       ARCHIVED
     }
     // Then use: phase EventPhase
     ```

3. **Audit/Moderation Logging**:
   - The plan mentions admin moderation and flagging, but there’s no explicit audit log or moderation record.
   - Optional: Add a `ModerationLog` model for tracking admin actions.

4. **User Data Export/Deletion**:
   - For privacy compliance, consider if you need a way to track deletion requests or exports (could be handled outside schema).

5. **Legal/Privacy**:
   - No schema changes needed, but ensure you have fields for data retention if required.

6. **Notification Delivery**:
   - If you want to track email notifications vs. in-app, you could add a `deliveryMethod` field to `Notification`.

### Summary
- The schema covers all major entities and most features.
- The main missing piece is a `Vote` model to support voting logic and history.
- Consider using enums for fields like `Event.phase` for type safety.
- Optionally, add moderation/audit logging if you want to track admin actions.

Would you like to proceed with adding a `Vote` model and updating `Event.phase` to use an enum?

-----------------------------------

**yes please**


The `Vote` model was added and `Event.phase` now uses an enum, but Prisma requires opposite relation fields for each relation. To fix this, I will add the necessary relation arrays to `Event`, `Artist`, and `Artwork` models.

I'll update the schema to resolve these errors.


The schema now includes a `Vote` model and uses an enum for `Event.phase`. Relation arrays for votes have been added to `Event`, `Artist`, and `Artwork` to resolve all Prisma relation errors.

Your schema is now aligned with the implementation plan and ready for voting logic. Let me know if you need migration or further changes.
