**Can you look over the "Implenetation Plan" document, and see if we're missing anything from this prisma schema?**

Here are a few things I spotted in the implementation plan that aren’t reflected in your current Prisma schema:

1. Voting data
   • You’ll need a Vote model (artist ←→ artwork, vote value, timestamp, maybe eventId) to record each user’s votes.
2. Event phase enforcement
   • Consider making your `Event.phase` field an enum (`OPEN`, `VOTING`, `CLOSED`, `ARCHIVED`) rather than a free‐form string.
3. Sessions / refresh tokens
   • If you plan to persist login sessions or issue refresh tokens you’ll need a Session (or Token) model.
4. Email verification
   • Beyond invitation tokens you may want a dedicated email-verification model or fields on Artist (and expire logic) if you’re doing sign-up flows.

Let me know if you’d like help extending the schema with any of these.

-----------------------------------

**please make any recommended changes**


I added:

- An `EventPhase` enum and updated `Event.phase` to use it.
- New `Vote` and `Session` models.
- Opposite relation fields (`votes` and `sessions`) on `Artist`, `Artwork`, and `Event`.
- Email verification fields (`isVerified`, `verificationToken`, `verificationTokenExpiry`) on `Artist`.

Run `prisma migrate dev --name extend_schema` to apply these changes.
