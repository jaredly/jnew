title: Jerd
draft: true

Some things that sets Jerd apart:

- algebraic effects, inspired by Unison, Eff, Koka.
- hash-addressed terms, inspired by unison
- structural type system inspired by flow/typescript and roc
  - default values!
- structure-first projectional language, inspired by hazel, lamdu, dark, and others
- colocated crdt-backed local-first data store, inspired by smalltalk, automerge, and others
- typed macros, inspired by ocaml
- compiles to multiple targets (javascript, golang, wasm, c(?))
- uncompromising purity, inspired by Roc / Elm
- sufficiently interactive compiler
- literal types with type algebra, inspired by zed, typescript
- loop/recur at the type level
- error coalescing, I haven't seen the like
- first-class code review
- type boxing! (related to rust's boxes and std::any https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/index.html)
  - this boxing is fancy though, because it you can nicely do enums of different types
