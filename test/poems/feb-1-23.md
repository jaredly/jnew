The wise man built his house upon a rock
with jack-hammers and hammer-drills
poured concrete and steel i-beams
a surer foundation you’ve never seen

and when the rains came down, and the wind blew,
and the floods came up, and came in,
the house was still standing! locked in place

Now, the wise woman built her house up in a tree.
careful not to disrupt its natural growth
it swayed in the wind, sure
but in a flood
it’s hard to beat being high and dry
