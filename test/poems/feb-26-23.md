In the heart of your heart
there is a kernel
of betrayal
<!-- more -->

the world is not
what you thought
it was

as your circle
of concern
grew larger
it became clear

things are not
working out
for most people
most of the time

and here
is the challenge:

Can you forgive
reality?

Richard Rohr talks about forgiving reality as the key to meekness. I heard on a podcast recently that Zion will not be brought about by a people who sin less and less, but rather a people who forgive more and more.
