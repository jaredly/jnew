Stand in holy places, they say
and be not moved. 
These places, not those places
you know the ones I mean. 
<!-- more -->
Stand with these people, not those people,
lest the stain of the world
overcome your cultivated roots
and bring forth an evil harvest

Stand in holy places,
and be not moved,
and shout to the unfortunates
in unholy places
to come to the Right place,
to cast off their worldly ways
and worldly ties 

Stand in holy places,
and be not moved,

but I am

moved

as God was
as I stand in this place
and that place
and all the holy
places
