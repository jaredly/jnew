God give me a church that is faithful
to the faithless
a church that is kind
to the angry
<!-- more -->
a church that repents
early and often
a church that is not boastful
envious, arrogant or rude
a church that is willing
to sacrifice
all things

God give me a church that is steadfast
in defending the weak
a church of fierce loyalty
one to another
a church of hearts
knit together
in one
