Adam's hair
is clean
Eve is
suitably bedraggled
created as she was
from the man's rib,
<!-- more -->
but Adam, freshly formed
from the mud and spit of God
is clean, as no baby every born was
his hair, a perfect wave, conditioned
and pains-takingly blow-dried

In the dreary world,
Eve, again, has the decency
to avoid looking like a shampoo commercial
but Adam's hair
is clean
the sweat of his brow
never makes it past the hairline
his almost plastic ken-doll hair
stubbornly refusing to be ruffled by the wind

In our vision
of the birth
of mankind
we skip the birth
the after-birth
the first washing
(who cleaned the blood
from his face
and hair?)
skip straight to the photo-op
and thereafter, always
have a stylist on hand
