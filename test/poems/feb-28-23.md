It's been some years
since I provided care to a widow
and to orphans, not at all
but I donate to a fund
that provides assistance
to such people in need

Years ago I tried
to visit, in prison
a former acquaintance
but never quite managed it
now I'm a pen pal
with a stranger doing time
eleven years in of fifteen

I've yet to provide lodging
to a stranger in our midst
but I occasionally provide
some local refugees with rides
to english classes

My religion isn't true
yet
but I like to think
I'm making progress
