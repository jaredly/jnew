when you’re getting tossed
to and fro
you hold on
to whatever you can find
<!-- more -->
even if it’s rough
rusty
sharp-edged
and hardly secure
itself

it’s only when the storm calms
for a moment
that you examine
your anchor
your rope
your ship
and consider
if this is the thing
that can carry you safely
from now onward
