when you’re getting tossed
to and fro
you hold on
to whatever you can find
<!-- more -->
even if it’s rough
rusty
sharp-edged
and hardly secure
itself

it’s only when the storm calms
for a moment
that you examine
your anchor
your rope
your ship
and consider
if this is the thing
that can carry you safely
going forward.

They say "there's no athiests in foxholes". And I recently heard on a podcast (I think it was "Tripp Fuller's Homebrew Christiantiy") someone comment that, as one's life becomes more "stable", e.g. you achieve some level of financial stability, some amount of worldly success etc. you start to really run up against the questions of meaning -- what does it all mean, how can I find meaning. If you're just scrambling to make ends meet, you often can't afford to be choosy with your theology; it's only when things settle that you can start to introspect.
