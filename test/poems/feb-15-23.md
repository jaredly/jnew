We’ve patented
the keys
to the universe
<!-- more -->

We don’t hoard them, no,
we’re quite free with sub-licenses
to any man who will agree to a few terms,
and recognize our claim, of course

God was so kind
as to grant us a monopoly
until such time
as the levites
are ready to take over

*This one's more unfinished than the others; it's in need of a fourth stanza, and I'm not sure how to wrap things up.*
