The world is full of miserable places. One way of living comfortably is not to think about them or, when you do, to send money.

I don't want to think about
the suffering of millions
from tuberculosis
<!-- more -->
I don't feel smart enough
to come up with a plan to fix it
What if
God has already thought about this
and has a perfect plan for fixing it
I've tried asking God
what the plan is to fix it
but I'm not getting anywhere
What if
Sharon Eubank has already asked God
what the plan is to fix it
and LDS Charities is implementing
that perfect plan
I'm so glad
I don't have to think about it
anymore.

There's a version of religiosity where we believe that God has made all of the important decisions, so I don't have to (God has a plan, we just need to learn what it is). And another step removed: the Prophet has discovered what God has decided, so I have to neither decide nor discover what the decision was.
One important aspect of my faith journey these past few years has been peeling back those layers -- first developing a conviction that I ought to discover for myself the will of God, and then the conviction that, in an astonishing number of cases, God actually wants me to make the decisions.
