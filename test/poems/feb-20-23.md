The three seconds
between the right cheek
and the left
are where the kingdom is built
<!-- more -->

do we succumb to natural fermentation
sweet righteous indignation
to intoxicating anger
to ascerbic disdain
bitter on the lips
as it spews forth

or, do we allow
alchemic grace
to ask “what good
is needed, here”
returning good for good
and good for evil
transmuting affront,
affliction, pain
somehow
to beauty

> If we do not transform our pain, we will most assuredly transmit it
