Remember that you are dust
and to dust you shall return
<!-- more -->

Remember that you are life
and to life you shall return

Remember that you are death
and to death you shall return

Remember that you are God
and to God you shall return

Remember that you are dust
and to dust you shall return

Ash Wednesday, went to a service at an episcopal church; my first time getting the ashen cross. Mormons don't generally think about being dust, or returning to dust -- we also don't do "ashes to ashes, dust to dust" over a grave. Perhaps we could use a little of the humility of that sentiment.
