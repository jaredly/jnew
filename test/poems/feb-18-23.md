The Anointed one
doesn’t seem to care
that if you keep lending
without expecting the money back
you’ll run out of money.

He says
do good
and lend, expecting nothing in return

I wish it weren’t up to me
to figure out how to make it all
add up

I was struck, reading Matthew 5, by the line "lend, expecting nothing in return." It's weird to think of lending money that way -- is he just saying that every loan should be considered a gift? In the jubilee year from the law of moses, all debts are to be forgiven, and land returned to its original owners, but that's only every 49 years. Perhaps he's just exhorting us to give lots of monetary gifts? Give generously to charity? Obviously I have a lot of questions about this.
