As a child I felt God as a warmth
A love, a comfort

That bearded man of blazing white
who helped me feel so safe at night
has failed to expand
with my expanding

The "who" of God once felt so clear
flesh and bone, atop a throne
but now I fear it seems
the image of my devotion
was an image after all

But here I am
struck dumb
barely coherent
with the loveliness
no that's not it
the grandeur
still wrong

almost bloated
with the gratitude
leaking out of my eyes
looking for a someone
to be grateful towards

the world
-- have you seen it?
I just
I can't

in spite of it all
it is good
it is very good
