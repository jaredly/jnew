How do you practice
what you preach?
How many times
and for how long?
<!-- more -->

At eleven
I was to practice 15 minutes
every day
twinkle twinkle
scales, and such
I didn't, really,
practice very well
many days I set a timer
then spent a while
applying rosin to the bow
ran through the songs
I already knew by rote
while thinking of other things
I didn't really *practice*
with an eye to improve
only an eye to fulfill
a requirement

How do you practice
what you preach?

Pondering rote (or "rehearsed" prayers) got me thinking about practicing what we preach. Do we preach extemporaneously, or with much preparation?
