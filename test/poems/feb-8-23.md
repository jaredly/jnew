It's bedtime
because I say it is
and because routine
and predictability
are important components
of stable home life
for a child of three

It's earlier
than bedtimes have been
because again
I've decided it should be
but mostly because
you've been so tired in the mornings
and were recently sick
no matter how much energy
you might claim to have
right now

and somehow
we're now disagreeing
about how clocks work
it is not three o'clock
or ten o'clock
it is eight o'clock
and it's bedtime
