When your body speaks
do you listen?
<!-- more -->

Do you know the names
and the shapes of your body?

Do you know the needs
and the fears of your body?

Do you know the secrets
and the joys of your body?

When your body listens
do you speak?

Inspired by getting a massage, and thinking for the first time about how my body might be hanging on to the time I broke my wrist in college, or the time I broke my femur as a 2-year-old.

The massage therapist would frequently talk to parts of my body that were holding on to tension, soothing them, asking what they were guarding against.
