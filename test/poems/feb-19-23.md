Scripture power
keeps me safe
I’m told
from sin,
temptation,
fiery darts
<!-- more -->

Maybe it works that way
for some people

I’ve had much more luck
with honest
open conversation
with people I trust

Scripture can inspire us
inform us
invite us into dialog
with God
and ourselves
can help us ponder
what ought to be

but for me
relationships
relationships
relationships
beat any book or prayer
for bringing me
to God

My three-year-old is learning this song in primary (it's quite rousing, and has some fun movements), but the message of the lyrics -- that we're in a battle, that "sin" is out to get you, and the scriptures will help you "win" is very far from my experience.
